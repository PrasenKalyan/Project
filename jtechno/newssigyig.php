I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request a leave of absence for [number of days] starting from [start date] to [end date] to undergo dental orthodontic treatment.

The treatment has been scheduled and recommended by my dentist, and it requires my immediate attention to ensure proper dental care. I assure you that 
I will do my best to mitigate any inconvenience caused by my absence.

During my absence, I have taken steps to ensure that my ongoing tasks and responsibilities are delegated appropriately to 
my colleagues, and I am available to provide any necessary guidance or information remotely.

I value the importance of my role within the team and will make every effort to ensure a smooth transition during my absence. 
I am also willing to work extra hours or make up for the missed time upon my return to ensure that the workflow remains unaffected.

I appreciate your understanding and support in this matter. Please let me know if there are any further steps I need to take or any 
additional information required to facilitate this leave request.


Thank you for your consideration.
