I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a leave of absence from work on 03-08-2023 as I 
need to drop my younger brother off at the airport. He has a flight scheduled for 14:20, and I would 
like to be there to ensure he has a smooth check-in process and see him off.

I understand the importance of my responsibilities at work, and I assure you that I will ensure all pending 
tasks are completed before I take my leave. If there are any urgent tasks that need to be handled in my
absence, I will make sure to delegate them to a colleague and provide clear instructions.

I anticipate that my absence will not disrupt the workflow and that my colleagues can manage any immediate
requirements during my brief absence.

Thank you for considering my leave request. I greatly appreciate your understanding in this matter.

If there is any additional information or documentation needed, please feel free to reach out to me.

Sincerely,

SYED OMER ALI
